<p>On June 16, 2009, a Minecraft player known as <a href="/w/User:Citricsquid" title="User:Citricsquid">citricsquid</a> created the <a href="Minecraft_Forum.html" title="Minecraft Forum">Minecraft Forums</a>. This was done in reaction to the large amount of spam on the official Minecraft forum created by <a href="Markus_Persson.html" title="Markus Persson">Notch</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>The next day, <a href="/w/User:Smirkenbowls?action=edit&redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Smirkenbowls (page does not exist)">Quatroking</a> wrote a suggestion to the forums. In the suggestion, he proposed to create a wiki for Minecraft. Citricsquid created the wiki as Quatroking suggested. Shortly after that, Quatroking became the wiki's first administrator.
</p><p>Back then, Minecraft Wiki was known as "Minepedia"<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> and was hosted at <code>minecraftwiki.net</code>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> There were many other wikis for Minecraft both before and after Minepedia. It's thought that Minepedia's ties with Notch and Minecraft Forums helped its popularity.
</p><p>On August 3, 2009, the forums and wiki went offline because citricsquid could no longer afford hosting. After 3 weeks, community member <a href="/w/User:Andrewgodwin" title="User:Andrewgodwin">aera</a>, known for creating the first ever custom server "myne!", offered to cover the costs. On August 28, 2009, the Minecraft Forums and Minepedia came back online.
</p><p>Both the forums and the wiki resumed their growth after this outage. As the community for <i>Minecraft</i> itself grew, so did the forum and the wiki. During that period, the number of visitors to the two websites doubled every 2 months.
</p><p>In July 2010, Minepedia created a wiki page for <i>Minecraft</i> bugs. This unofficial bug tracker was how players reported bugs in practice back then. It's currently found at <a href="/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Issues" title="Minecraft Wiki:Issues">Minecraft Wiki:Issues</a>.
</p><p>On August 19, 2010, a backup failure caused loss of all edits from August 3 to August 18.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> As a result, the community started discussing a new hosting plan. Community member <a href="/w/User:WedTM737@legacy41471684?action=edit&redlink=1" class="new" title="User:WedTM737@legacy41471684 (page does not exist)">WedTM</a> offered more hardware. However, despite this gift, the growth of the two websites kept causing further issues. Later that same month, anonymous editing was disabled due to the large amount of unconstructive activity coming from such users.
</p><p>Over September, the two websites had a five-fold growth in daily views: from 200,000 to 1,000,000. Hosting costs reached $2,000 per month, and the hosting team asked the community for donations. In one week, $3,500 was raised, which was enough to rent better hardware. For a more stable income, the hosting team added ads shortly after that. These changes made it needed to create a legal entity responsible for the sites. On September 30, 2010, <a href="/w/Redstone_Wire_Ltd" title="Redstone Wire Ltd">Redstone Wire Ltd</a> was formed and incorporated.
</p><p>During October, the wiki and the forum had regular technical issues as their popularity kept rising. By that time, the two sites together became almost as popular as StackOverflow, and it was harder and harder to manage them.
</p><p>In October, wiki editors made some major changes to how they discuss the wiki. Originally, <a href="TalkMinecraft_Wiki.html" title="Talk:Minecraft Wiki">the talk page of the wiki's main page</a> was used both to discuss the main page itself and to discuss the wiki in general. This made it harder to find relevant topics in archives. On October 14, wiki editors created <a href="Minecraft_WikiCommunity_portal.html" title="Minecraft Wiki:Community portal">the community portal page</a>. Shortly after that, the community portal became a hub for links (to the forums and to <a href="Minecraft.net.html" title="Minecraft.net">Minecraft.net</a>), and on October 20, it became the on-wiki forum for wiki discussion. The talk page for the main page had its content moved to the community portal the following week.

<p>In fall 2010, the wiki space was experiencing one of the biggest events in its history. Up until then, 99.9% of non-Wikimedia Foundation wiki space (known also as Fan-wiki space) was dominated by the wiki platform Wikia (today known as Fandom). Wikia's newest fixed-width skin, Oasis, was met with strong disapproval by various wiki editors, which meant people had intentions to leave Wikia, which in turn was a good time for other companies to offer their own wiki services. One of those companies which took advantage of this was Curse.
</p><p>Curse started as a database of World of Warcraft mods, but by 2009, they had expanded to other areas (such as forums for example). It was at that time Curse decided to host their first wiki. It wasn't their first interaction with wiki space either. In 2007, they had a short-lived partnership with Wikia, which lasted for just 5 months,<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> but it was enough for them to realize that there was a space for something like a wiki farm. After seeing decent success with the wikis they were hosting, they decided to expand. The process was still very slow, as by the end of October 2010, Curse had just 7 wikis. However, at the same time, there was drama surrounding Wikia and so Curse took the stage - they began looking for more wikis to host.
</p><p>At the beginning of November 2010, the president of Curse, Donovan Duncan, reached out to citricsquid and the team. The deal was that Curse would acquire sites under "Redstone Wire Ltd" and would hire citricsquid, aera and WedTM. By November 15, 2010, the site was owned by Curse.
</p><p>A few weeks later in December 2010, "Minepedia" had to be renamed to "Minecraft Wiki", since the owners of the domain "minepedia.net" faced a legal issue, which concluded that the wiki could no longer be named as "Minepedia". However, the transition was very slow, and references were still being changed throughout 2011. <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>In the following months, the Minecraft Wiki improved its management pages. In late December 2010, the community portal was transformed to be a more useful page for users<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>, followed by the creation of the <a href="/w/Admin_noticeboard" class="mw-redirect" title="Admin noticeboard">Admin noticeboard</a> in early January 2011.
</p><p>The excessive usage of images on the wiki had been stressing the hosting server for some time. This resulted in the idea of using a single image: a stylesheet added through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:CSS">CSS</a> with all blocks and items on the bitmap. This would display parts of this one image. This became a template known as <code>{{<a href="/w/Template:Sprite" title="Template:Sprite">Sprite</a>}}</code>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>In June 2011, the Minecraft Wiki community raised concerns regarding Curse for the first time.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> This was due to Curse adding a sidebar for some promotional materials and later ads. Despite the protests from community members, the sidebar remained until early 2013, when the wiki migrated to the Gamepedia platform.
</p><p>On September 6, 2011, anonymous editing was re-enabled after the implementation of extra tools, such as the <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AbuseFilter" class="extiw" title="mw:Extension:AbuseFilter">Abuse Filter</a>, to counter unconstructive edits.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> September 2011 also marked the closure of <code>minepedia.net</code><sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>. Since then, the Minecraft Wiki has been the biggest wiki about Minecraft with no significant competition to challenge it.
</p><p>In August 2012, the Minecraft Wiki decided to change its wiki logo and header.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> The header was been implemented right away, but it took a year for the logo to be changed, finally being replaced on September 24, 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

<p>With the number of wikis Curse was hosting rising rapidly, more and more problems came along with upgrading them. Since all of the wikis ran on their own MediaWiki cores, updating them caused their technical issues to last for longer periods of time. Additionally, due to how each wiki was on its own URL, features like site-wide logging could not exist, and SEO was per-wiki, which wasn't ideal if somebody wanted to compete with Wikia.
</p><p>That was an inspiration of the Gamepedia wiki farm, powered by the "Hydra" wiki engine. This introduced a single MediaWiki core, easily manageable extensions, and site-wide logging. This also made Gamepedia wikis stronger in SEO. The move was completed in August 2013. As an added bonus, Curse decided to get rid of the controversial right sidebar the wiki had been hating for a long period of time.
</p><p>In May 2013, the wiki had been experiencing server issues, with the proposal being to remove images from <code>{{<a href="/w/Template:Blocks" class="mw-redirect" title="Template:Blocks">Blocks</a>}}</code> and <code>{{<a href="/w/Template:Items" class="mw-redirect" title="Template:Items">Items</a>}}</code>.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> As most of the editors hadn't agreed, the alternative was to use <code>{{<a href="/w/Template:LoadPage" title="Template:LoadPage">LoadPage</a>}}</code>. At that time, that template was used very rarely, but the server issues still caused a lot of navboxes to be converted into these pages. This improved the performance of the wiki. Meanwhile, the creation of new namespaces ​<sup class="noprint nowrap Inline-Template" title="">[<i><a class="text" href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki_talk:History"><span title="Which namespaces?" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">more information needed</span></a></i>]</sup> was requested, although it wasn't agreed on.
</p><p>A few days later, there was a proposal about the wiki header's color and the agreed conclusion was to change its text color to white.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> There was another discussion to change its background color, but it stayed on <span style="display: inline-block; white-space: nowrap;"><span style="display: inline-block; background-color: #729fcf; border: 1px solid #888; border-radius: 0.3em; width: 1em; height: 1em; vertical-align: -0.4em; margin-right: -0.1em"><br></span> <code>#729fcf</code></span> (until 2021).
</p><p>In September 2013, "Minetip" tooltips were officially introduced.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>
</p><p>Until late 2013, all versions of an edition were hosted on a single page. This started to become a problem during <a href="/w/Java_Edition_1.7" title="Java Edition 1.7">Java Edition 1.7</a>'s development in October 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> The first page was for <a href="Java_Edition_1.8.html" title="Java Edition 1.8">Java Edition 1.8</a>, at that time called "1.8". To make sure users will be able to navigate from a one version to an another one with ease, a navbox was created<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> It was also decided "Pocket Edition" and <a href="Legacy_Console_Edition.html" title="Legacy Console Edition">Legacy Console Edition</a> versions would also use their own prefix, and while Pocket Edition started to use this system in 2015, it took 6 more years for Console Editions, way after version pages had taken over the wiki.
</p><p>On May 7, 2014, Curse introduced <a href="https://help.fandom.com/wiki/Extension:CurseProfile" class="extiw" title="gphelp:Extension:CurseProfile" rel="nofollow">Curse Profiles</a>, an integrated social media system in Gamepedia offering a wide range of features. It was meant to be an alternative for user pages and user talk pages, which would display the same information across the entire network.
</p><p>In Late 2014, the <a href="https://ftb.fandom.com/wiki/" class="extiw" title="ftb:" rel="nofollow">Official Feed the Beast Wiki</a> migrated to Gamepedia. Therefore, a logical question began circulating on wikis  about the future of <a href="Mods.html" title="Mods">Mods</a> on this wiki, but it took a few years for the editors to make a decision on it.
</p><p>In October 2014, it had been suggested to create a namespace alias. Since then, <code>MCW:</code> and <code>MCT:</code> are aliases for "Minecraft Wiki" and "Minecraft Wiki talk" namespaces respectively.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>
</p><p>On March 14, 2015, <a href="/w/Minecraft_Wiki:TALK" class="mw-redirect" title="Minecraft Wiki:TALK">Talk page guidelines</a> were introduced.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>
</p><p>In January 2016, a mobile app finally launched for the Minecraft Wiki. The mobile app was one of the most requested features from both readers and editors since at least 2011. However, the excitement around it didn't last long, since it was met with lot of criticism, concerning its inability to edit pages, read other namespaces or just reading other languages.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> While there were plans to add offline mode, add other languages and other features, it didn't take too long for the app to be abandoned. The last update was released in August 2016, and since then the app has been crashing for everybody, until it was withdrawn from the store sometime in 2017.
</p><p>On July 18, 2016 at around 15:00 UTC, Minecraft Wiki surpassed 1 million edits, with the 1-millionth edit being done by <a href="/w/User:Meeples10" title="User:Meeples10">Meeples10</a>.

<p>On August 26, 2016, Curse was acquired by Amazon through its subsidiary "Twitch Interactive". Slowly, Amazon's influence was becoming stronger, with Twitch streams as a new type of advertisement starting to appear at the bottom of the pages not long after. On November 24, 2017, Minecraft Wiki had been moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Amazon Web Services">Amazon Web Services</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

</p><p>In 2017, Gamepedia announced an end to its Gamepedia PRO paid service, being replaced by free Gamepedia PRO which could be earned by editing wikis.
</p><p>As instant messaging services were becoming more and more common, there was a growing need for a wiki Discord.

<p>Until March 9, 2019, the wiki primarily focused on Java Edition. After all, this was the original Minecraft, while the rest were created long after. However, this started to change.
</p><p>On June 13, 2017, a topic was opened on community portal, talking about the orientation of the wiki,<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> which resulted in a wiki project called "<a href="/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Projects/Renaming" title="Minecraft Wiki:Projects/Renaming">Renaming</a>". The goal of it was simple - "focus on other editions of Minecraft". This project was influential to the Minecraft community from the day 1 of the project. On June 17, 2017, the term <a href="Bedrock_Edition.html" title="Bedrock Edition">Bedrock Edition</a> saw its first usage, which was a term which later became de facto standard for the wiki and community as a whole and in the end was officially adopted by Mojang and became the official name of the edition, starting June 7, 2022. On June 23, 2017, at that time Mojang's current Community manager and wiki editor, <a href="/w/User:HelenAngel" class="mw-redirect" title="User:HelenAngel">HelenAngel</a>, stepped in and tried to discuss her stance and how it has been referred at Mojang. While the argument for why Bedrock Edition shouldn't be named as "Bedrock Edition" haven't persuaded rest of the wiki editors, her comment about Console Edition rename did, so wiki came to the agreement, that since Console Edition does no longer include all editions, it should be suffixed by word "Legacy", so Console Edition became Legacy Console Edition.
</p><p>After the <a href="/w/Bedrock_Edition_1.2.0" title="Bedrock Edition 1.2.0">Bedrock Edition 1.2.0</a> came though, the discussion staled, as the proposal to begin the move failed<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>. After the discussion was revived in January 2019, wiki agreed on prefixing versions.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> Pages started to focus more on all editions of the game. All Java Edition articles have received "Java Edition" prefix (for example, 1.12.2 became Java Edition 1.12.2) starting March 9, 2019, while pages without prefix have become disambiguations.
</p><p>June 2019 was a very active month. There was a discussion about if the wiki should continue to use videos from "MCspotlights", a channel founded by Curse, that employed two YouTubers to make videos about Minecraft for Minecraft Wiki and embed them into pages. Since in 2015, the Curse decided to cancel mcspotlight project, as the time went by, the videos they produced were getting more and more outdated, to the point one wiki editor started to remove them. After being brought up on the community portal<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>, the discussion resulted into a creation of wiki project called "Wiki videos". This project, while very ambiguous, it ended up as a flop few years afterwards.
</p><p>As a result of an another discussion, which ran from June to September 2019, wiki officially disallows its pages to be created by anonymous users, starting September 11, 2019. Until then, creation of new pages was restricted by an abuse filter, allowing only redirects creation for anonymous users and newly registered users.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>
</p><p>And finally, since June 2019, wiki has been discussing proposal to document Minecraft spin offs and other games (<a href="Minecraft_Earth.html" title="Minecraft Earth">Minecraft Earth</a>, <a href="Minecraft_Dungeons.html" title="Minecraft Dungeons">Minecraft Dungeons</a>, <a href="Minecraft_Story_Mode.html" title="Minecraft: Story Mode">Minecraft: Story Mode</a>). This discussion took several months, and the discussion turned into fighting about the scope of the wiki. Eventually, after the discussion was scheduled to close in early 2020, the final decision was creation of a separate <a href="https://help.fandom.com/wiki/Namespace" class="extiw" title="gphelp:Namespace" rel="nofollow">namespace</a> for Minecraft Dungeons, while Minecraft Earth in main namespace. Since the content has been documented as subpages of wiki projects, the moving was progressing quickly. 
</p><p>However, in few days it was decided the Minecraft Earth information may be conflicting with the page and the movement of the pages was put on halt. The result was a discussion, where it was decided that Minecraft Earth will also receive its own namespace.
</p><p>As the wiki was becoming more complex and version histories were longer, it became clear there may be a need for simplified guides. This was already fulfilled in late 2018 to early 2019, with 1.13 and 1.14 guides. However, the guides really took off after they the links to the pages been added to <code>{{<a href="/w/Template:Java_Edition_versions" class="mw-redirect" title="Template:Java Edition versions">Java Edition versions</a>}}</code> in late 2019, which spawned lot of interest into guides and together with <code>{{<a href="/w/Template:Simple_Guide_table" title="Template:Simple Guide table">Simple Guide table</a>}}</code>, all big major updates have had their guides created in coming months. 
</p><p>During 2020, as a result of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:COVID-19">COVID 19</a> pandemic, the wiki activity increased significantly. This prompted much bigger projects, such as creation of launcher versions, together with Legacy Console Edition. Until September 2020, <a href="Legacy_Console_Edition_version_history.html" title="Legacy Console Edition version history">Legacy Console Edition version history</a> page listed all version changelogs for all console editions prior to discontinuation of PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PlayStation Vita editions, with the exception of PlayStation 4 editions released after the discontinuation of these 3 editions. Ultimately, it was decided that it would be moved to their own pages, with the similar versions sharing one changelog from a special template.
</p><p>The wiki has been moved to Unified Community Platform (UCP), a new platform uniting Fandom and Gamepedia wikis, on October 5, 2020. In early 2021, as part of "UCX project" at Fandom, the wiki received a new mobile skin called "<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://community.fandom.com/wiki/Help:FandomMobile">FandomMobile</a>".

<p>After Gamepedia has been bought by Fandom, some of the admins from Fandom Minecraft Wiki (today's location at "minecraft-archive.fandom.com") joined Gamepedia Minecraft Wiki Discord server to discuss cooperation with each other. Initially, users disagreed with each other, as many users had thoughts that Fandom wiki is "useless", citing the weird way of documenting versions and allowance of mod documentation. However, this started to change in early 2019, as "Project Crossover" was announced by both Fandom and Gamepedia. In late December 2019, the Minecraft Wiki Discord server agreed on opening a discussion about a protentional merge with Fandom wiki. It was already clear, that Fandom will merge to Gamepedia, since Gamepedia was official wiki after all, just the question was, if it will actually happen. There were some people, who thought the Fandom wiki will co-exist with the Gamepedia one (which, as was later proved, wasn't the case). As such, a "Minecraft Wikis Crossover" Discord server was created.
</p><p>However, the discussion wasn't active at all, and was somewhat revived, when the migration of Gamepedia wikis to Fandom domain was announced. While this spawned discussion about "3 Minecraft Wikis" and crossovers with other wikis, there wasn't a real progress in talks. The discussion finally became active, when the migration to Fandom domain officially began. The process of resolving conflicting wikis would make Fandom wiki unsearchable in search results, so the process has been sped up. Following a poll on Legacy Fandom Minecraft Wiki, with more than 53% of people supporting the crossover and a support between administrators, Fandom's original Minecraft Wiki was archived on March 9, 2021, and banner was added directing people to this Minecraft Wiki.
</p><p>During this time, Gamepedia wiki was solving an only blocker, which may prevent the fork from happening. The Fandom Wiki has been using <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://community.fandom.com/wiki/Help:Discussions">Discussions</a> system, which allowed a discussion about anything Minecraft or wiki related. Following a discussion, it was decided Minecraft Wiki won't enable discussions.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> In the end, this didn't stop the crossover from happening. On March 22, 2021, this wiki was migrated to "fandom.com" domain, while the archived wiki got moved to its current location, "minecraft-archive.fandom.com".
</p><p>Following this successful Crossover, more crossovers happened. However, Minecraft Story Mode Wiki was the one which opposed, despite reapproaching several times. This prompted "Minecraft Story Mode Wiki" wiki project to take off. On August 26, 2021, this project ended up with "Minecraft Story Mode" namespace being set-up.

<p>In early October 2021, it was announced that Microsoft has terminated an official wiki partnership<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>. The wiki was forced to make changes to main page and change its logo it had been using since 2013. Since then, Minecraft Wiki moved on towards becoming the most useful guide for everything Minecraft, even though the activity declined.
</p><p>During the next 15 months activity on the wiki decreased along with many active editors leaving the community. Additionally due to changes in wiki's ownership, discussions regarding moving wiki to another wiki platform arose in the community as a result of many concerns in regards to reputation of Fandom.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> Ultimately those discussions died down as the move was considered too risky. 
</p><p>However, there were some decisions made. The wiki agreed on abandoning "Official pages"<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> and decided to grant <a href="/w/User:Amatulic" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> and <a href="/w/User:Magiczocker" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Magiczocker">Magiczocker</a> admin rights, following a discussion<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>.
</p><p>On January 24, 2023, Fandom disabled anonymous editing on the Minecraft Wiki<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>, as they determined it as a wiki "for kids". The change decreased the amount of vandalism the wiki experienced, as most vandalism was done by anonymous accounts. However, the change also decreased activity of the wiki, as anonymous editors made up a large portion of people that edited the wiki.
</p><p>A namespace for <i>Minecraft Legends</i> was created on January 30, 2023.
</p><p>After about two years of inactivity, the wiki's English <a href="/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Social_media#X_(Twitter)" title="Minecraft Wiki:Social media">Twitter account</a> became active again on March 10, 2023. Additionally, in July 2023, a <a href="/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Social_media#Mastodon" title="Minecraft Wiki:Social media">Minecraft Wiki Mastodon</a> account was created.
</p><p>During 2023, the discussions about the wiki leaving Fandom started to become more serious. Initially, these discussions took place on the <a href="Minecraft_WikiDiscord.html" title="Minecraft Wiki:Discord">Discord server</a>, but later also on <a href="/w/Minecraft_Wiki_talk:Community_portal/Archive_38#Move_to_a_different_wiki_host?" title="Minecraft Wiki talk:Community portal/Archive 38">the Community Portal</a>, where several frustrations with the status quo were voiced. With wiki hosts gradually reaching out and offering to host the Minecraft Wiki, on July 3, 2023, a <a href="/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Moving_from_Fandom/First_discussion" title="Minecraft Wiki:Moving from Fandom/First discussion">first discussion</a> about a potential fork was started on the wiki. This discussion resulted in a broad consensus about moving from Fandom, but not about which host to move to. However, it caught a lot of outside attention, including <a href="https://weirdgloop.org/" class="extiw" title="wg:">Weird Gloop</a>'s. They, as the host of the Runescape wikis, subsequently also offered their expertise in forking and hosting wikis and to host the Minecraft Wiki.
</p><p>As Weird Gloop seemed like a promising option and the decision for where to move to was still unclear, a <a href="/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Moving_from_Fandom/Second_discussion" title="Minecraft Wiki:Moving from Fandom/Second discussion">second discussion</a> was started on July 31, 2023, which resulted in consensus about choosing Weird Gloop as a host. An interim <a href="/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Board" title="Minecraft Wiki:Board">board</a> was set up, consisting of five volunteering directors, with the intent to organize the fork in a more centralized manner.

<p>On September 24, 2023, the Minecraft Wiki <a href="Minecraft_WikiMoving_from_Fandom.html" title="Minecraft Wiki:Moving from Fandom">moved from Fandom</a> to its own independent site "minecraft.wiki", hosted by Weird Gloop. The new wiki featured a similar skin to the one used on Gamepedia, but with a modernized design and a tweaked logo, both created by <a href="/w/Special:Contributions/Oakar567" title="Special:Contributions/Oakar567">Oakar567</a>, as well as a redesigned main page.
</p><p>Subsequently, <a href="UserMarkusRost.html" title="User:MarkusRost">MarkusRost</a>, who is an admin of the German Minecraft wiki and also previously was a Wiki Representative for the Minecraft Wikis for some time while the wiki was part of Fandom, became a new administrator. Additionally, <a href="UserNixinova.html" title="User:Nixinova">Nixinova</a>, who was a bureaucrat who left the wiki earlier this year, returned once again as a bureaucrat.
</p><p>In mid-November 2023, the first round of language wikis <a href="/w/Minecraft_Wiki:News/First_language_wikis_moved" title="Minecraft Wiki:News/First language wikis moved">moved from Fandom</a> to "*.minecraft.wiki" as well. A second round of language wikis also followed in February 2024.
